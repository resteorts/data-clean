Blocking
===

- Blocking places similar records into partitions/blocks.

- ER (typically) is only performed within each block. 

Traditional Blocking
===

- A deterministic (fixed) partition is formed based upon the data. 
- A partition is created by treating certain fields that are thought to be nearly error-free as fixed.

Example: Blocking on date of birth year. 

Traditional Blocking
===

- Benefits:  simple, easy to understand, and fast to implement. 
- Downsides: the blocks are treated as error free, which is not usually accurate and can lead to errors in the ER task that cannot be accounted for. 



Probabilistic Blocking 
===

- A probability model is used to cluster the data into blocks/partitions. 

Example: Fellegi-Sunter (1969), or Locality Sensitive Hashing  

Under both blocking approaches, record pairs that do not meet the blocking criteria are automatically classified as non-matches.

# Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation metrics are important for ER as they help us evaluate our proposed methodology (as long as some notion of ground truth exists). 

The three that we will focus on in this module are:

- reduction ratio
- precision
- recall
- f-measure

# Reduction Ratio

The reduction ratio (RR) measures the relative reduction of the comparison space from the de-duplication or hashing technique. 

\vspace*{1em}

See Christen (2012), Steorts, Ventura, Sadinle, Fienberg (2014) for a formal definition. 

# Pairwise Precision and Recall

Let's now turn to formally defining the pairwise precision and recall. 

# The confusion matrix


\begin{enumerate}
\item  Pairs of data can be linked in both the handmatched
training data (which we refer to as ``truth") and under the estimated
linked data. We refer to this situation as true positives (TP). 
\item Pairs of data can be linked under the truth but not linked under the estimate, which
are called false negatives (FN). 
\item Pairs of data can be not linked under the truth but linked under the estimate, which are called false positives (FP). 
\item Pairs of data can be not linked under the truth and also not linked
under the estimate, which we refer to as true negatives (TN).
\end{enumerate}

# The confusion matrix

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{finalFigures/confusion}
    \caption{Data cleaning pipeline.}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}


# Pairwise evaluation metrics

$$\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} = 1 - \text{FNR}.$$

$$\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} = 1 - \text{FDR}.$$

$$\text{F-measure} = 2 \times \frac{(precision \times recall)}{(precision + recall)}.$$


# Recall

- For blocking, it is critical the recall be as close a possible to 1. 

\vspace*{1em}

- To think about why, what does it mean if we have a blocking criterion where our recall is 0.5? 

\vspace*{1em}

See Shrivastava and Steorts (2018) and Chen, Shrivastava, Steorts (2018) for further regarding about blocking criterion using human rights data. 

# Example: RLdata500

Let's return to the RLdata500 data set, where we will block by last name initial. 

Our goal are the following:

- visualize the blocks
- compute the evaluation metrics introduced

# Example: RLdata500

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
head(RLdata500)
```

# Example: Traditional blocking

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{FinalFigures/noblocking_plot.pdf}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{FinalFigures/blocking_plot.pdf}
    \caption{All-to-all record comparisons (left) versus partitioning records into blocks by lastname initial and comparing records only within each partition (right).}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}



# RLdata500 (Continued)

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Total number of all to all record comparisons
choose(500,2)
```

# RLdata500 (Continued)

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Block by last name initial  
last_init <- substr(RLdata500[,"lname_c1"], 1, 1)
head(last_init)

# Total number of blocks
length(unique(last_init))
```

# RLdata500 (Continued)

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Total number of records per block
recordsPerBlock <- table(last_init)
head(recordsPerBlock)
```

# RLdata500 (Continued)

Observe that the block sizes vary. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5}
# Block sizes can vary 
plot(recordsPerBlock, 
     cex.axis=0.6, xlab="", ylab="")
```


# RLdata500 (Continued)

What is the overall dimension reduction form the original space to the reduced space induced by blocking? 

# RLdata500 (Continued)

Recall the total number of all-to-all record comparisons made was:
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
choose(500, 2)
```

Using blocking, we have reduced the compison space to the following:
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sum(choose(recordsPerBlock, 2))
```

# How do we calculate the reduction ratio (RR)?

The reduction ratio is
$$
  \text{RR} = \text{\% comparisons eliminated by blocking.}
$$

```{r}
(choose(500, 2) - sum(choose(recordsPerBlock, 2))) / 
choose(500, 2)
```

# How do we calculate the RR (via a function)?

```{r}
reduction.ratio <- function(block.labels) {
  n_all_comp = choose(length(block.labels), 2)
  n_block_comp = sum(choose(table(block.labels), 2))

  (n_all_comp - n_block_comp) / n_all_comp
}

reduction.ratio(last_init)
```

# Reduction Ratio

In summary, we have reduced the comparison space by roughly 88 percent. 

# Evaluation metrics

Let's now code up the evaluation metrics for pairwise precision and recall.  


# Pairwise Precision

\small
```{r}
precision <- function(block.labels, IDs) {
  ct = xtabs(~block.labels+IDs)
  
  # Number of true positives
  TP = sum(choose(ct, 2))
  
  # Number of positives = TP + FP
  P = sum(choose(rowSums(ct), 2)) 
  
  return(TP/P)
}
```
\normalfont

# Pairwise Recall

\small
```{r}
recall <- function(block.labels, IDs) {
  ct = xtabs(~IDs+block.labels)
  
  # Number of true positives
  TP = sum(choose(ct, 2))
  
  # Number of true links = TP + FN
  TL = sum(choose(rowSums(ct), 2))
  
  return(TP/TL)
}
```
\normalsize

# Pairwise Precision and Recall

\small
```{r}
precision(last_init, identity.RLdata500)
recall(last_init, identity.RLdata500)
precision(last_init, identity.RLdata500) == 
  recall(identity.RLdata500, last_init)
```
\normalsize

# Italian Survey on Household and Wealth (SHIW)

- We will now explore a case study to the Italian Survey on Household and Wealth (SHIW)
- The SHIW is a sample survey 383 households conducted by the Bank of Italy every two years (2008 and 2010).
- The data set is anonymized to remove first and last name (and other sensitive information). 

# SHIW

The following attribute information is available: 
\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item PARENT (parental status)
\item GENDER
\item ANASC (year of birth)
\item NASCREG (working status)
\item CIT (employment status)
\item ACOM4C (branch of activity)
\item STUDIO (town size)
\item Q (quality of life status)
\item QUAL (whether or not Italian national)
\item SETT (highest educational level obtained)
\item IREG (region of italy)
\end{itemize}

# Explore Data

\tiny
```{r}
head(italy08) # first year of SHIW
```

# Explore Data

\tiny
```{r}
head(italy10) # second year of SHIW
```

# Reformat Data

\footnotesize
```{r}
id08 <- italy08$id
id10 <- italy10$id
id <- c(italy08$id, italy10$id) # combine the id
italy08 <- italy08[-c(1)] # remove the id
italy10 <- italy10[-c(1)] # remove the id 
italy <- rbind(italy08, italy10)
head(italy)
```



# Your turn

- Construct a blocking criterion for the SHIW data set
- Provide code to construct the blocks
- Are your blocks well balanced?
- What is the reduction ratio? 
- What is the pairwise recall and precision?
- Would you recommend your blocking criterion for an ER task? Why or why not. 

Hint: You might consider blocking on gender, regions (in Italy), or combinations of these. What do you find? 

# Your turn solution

Let's block on gender.

```{r}
# block by gender 
blockByGender <- italy$SEX
recordsPerBlock <- table(blockByGender)
head(recordsPerBlock)
```

# Your turn solution

The block sizes are similar. But note, they are still quite large. 

```{r}
# Checking block sizes 
plot(recordsPerBlock,
cex.axis=0.6, xlab="", ylab="")
```

# Your turn solution
```{r}
print(rr <- reduction.ratio(blockByGender))
```

We have reduced the overall space by rougly 50 percent. 

# Your turn solution

```{r}
precision(blockByGender, id)
recall(blockByGender, id)
```



<!-- # Your turn solution 1 -->

<!-- \tiny -->

<!-- Let's block on the twenty regions in Italy.  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- blockRule <- (italy$IREG)  -->
<!-- (recordsPerBlock <- table(blockRule)) -->
<!-- plot(recordsPerBlock, -->
<!-- cex.axis=0.6, xlab="", ylab="") -->
<!-- print(rr <- reduction.ratio(blockRule)) -->
<!-- precision(blockRule, id) -->
<!-- recall(blockRule, id) -->
<!-- ``` -->

# Your turn solution 2

Let's block on a combination of gender and region. 

Hint: Use \texttt{tidyverse}. 

# Your turn solution 2

\tiny
```{r, message=FALSE}
italy %>% 
 group_by(IREG, SEX) %>% 
 summarise(count = n(), .groups="drop") %>% 
 ggplot() +
 geom_histogram(aes(count))
```

# Your turn solution 2

\tiny
```{r}
blockIDs = paste(italy$IREG, italy$SEX, sep="_")
table(blockIDs)
print(rr <- reduction.ratio(blockIDs))
```

# Your turn solution 2
```{r}
precision(blockIDs, id)
recall(blockIDs, id)
```
