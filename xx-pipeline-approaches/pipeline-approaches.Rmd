Recap of Pipeline Approach
===

- Explain the pipeline. Go!

Recap of deterministic record linkage
===

- What are some examples of how you can perform deterministic record linkage?
- What are the benefits?
- What is the downside?
- How could you put deterministic rules together to build more complex rules? 






Load R packages
===

```{r message=FALSE}
library(RecordLinkage)
```

Data Cleaning Pipeline
===

Deterministic Record Linkage
===

The most commonly used record linkage methods are based on a series of deterministic rules involving the comparison of record attributes.


Exact Matching and off by $k$ matching
===

- Exact matching is where two record pairs are linked if they
agree on all common attributes.

\pause

- Off by one matching links records pairs if they link on all common attributes (except for one). 

\pause

- Off by two matching links record pairs if they link on all common attributes (except for two). 

\pause

Exact Matching and off by $k$ matching
===

An extension, off by k-matching, states that two record pairs
are a match if they match on all common attributes except at most k, where k is an integer larger than 0.

\vspace*{2em}

\pause

Exact matching (or extensions) are used when all the attributes are categorical as it tends to perform well, as opposed to when textual variables are introduced.


RLdata500
===

Consider the \texttt{RLdata500} data set, removing any columns that contain missing values.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(blink) # load RLdata500
data(RLdata500)
data <- RLdata500[-c(2,4)] # Remove missing values
head(data)
```

All pairs of records
===

Now let's consider all possible pairs of records.

```{r}
# create all pairs of records
pairs <- t(combn(1:nrow(RLdata500), 2))
head(pairs)
```

Pairwise features that disagree
===

For each pair of records, compute the number of features that disagree.\footnote{This takes a few minute to compute in \texttt{R}. (There are more efficient ways to do this).}

```{r, cache=TRUE}
n_disagree = sapply(1:nrow(pairs), function(i) {
  recordA = data[pairs[i,1],]
  recordB = data[pairs[i,2],]
  sum(recordA != recordB)
})
```

Distribution of Feature Disagreement Among Record Pairs
===

\footnotesize 
```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3, fig.align="center"}
plot(table(n_disagree), 
     xlab="Number of features that  disagree",
     ylab="Total number of record pairs")
```

What do you observe?
===

\footnotesize 
```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3, fig.align="center" ,echo=FALSE}
plot(table(n_disagree), 
     xlab="Number of features that  disagree",
     ylab="Total number of record pairs")
```

Distribution of Feature Disagreement Among Record Pairs
===

- Observe that record pairs disagree on four or 5 features. We expect these records to not be matched. 

\pause

- Pairs disagreeing only on 1, 2 or 3 features *might* be matches.

\pause 

\vspace*{2em}

Is this intuitive? 

Exact Matching, Etc
===

Now, let's investigate exact matching (and extensions) on the \texttt{RLdata500} data set. 


Exact Matching 
===

**Exact matching:** Link record pairs that agree on all features. 

\vspace*{1em}

```{r}
sum(n_disagree == 0)
```

\vspace*{1em}

No pairs are exact matches! 


Off by one matching
===

**Off by 1 matching:** Link record pairs that disagree only in one feature.


\vspace*{1em}
\footnotesize
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Links
links = pairs[n_disagree <= 1, ]

# Number of estimated links
nrow(links)

# Number of correctly estimated links
sum(sapply(1:nrow(links), function(i) {
  identity.RLdata500[links[i,1]] == 
    identity.RLdata500[links[i,2]]
}))
```

Off by two matching
===

How would you extend this to off by two matching? 

What do you find? 

<!-- Off by two matching example -->
<!-- === -->

<!-- **Off by 2 matching:** link record pairs that disagree only in two features. -->


<!-- \vspace*{1em} -->
<!-- \footnotesize -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # Links -->
<!-- links = pairs[n_disagree <= 2, ] -->

<!-- # Number of estimated links -->
<!-- nrow(links) -->

<!-- # Number of correctly estimated links -->
<!-- sum(sapply(1:nrow(links), function(i) { -->
<!--   identity.RLdata500[links[i,1]] == identity.RLdata500[links[i,2]] -->
<!-- })) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Off by three matching example -->
<!-- === -->

<!-- **Off by 3 matching:** link record pairs which disagree only in three features.  -->

<!-- \vspace*{1em} -->
<!-- \footnotesize -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # Links -->
<!-- links = pairs[n_disagree <= 3, ] -->

<!-- # Number of estimated links -->
<!-- nrow(links) -->

<!-- # Number of correctly estimated links -->
<!-- sum(sapply(1:nrow(links), function(i) { -->
<!--   identity.RLdata500[links[i,1]] == identity.RLdata500[links[i,2]] -->
<!-- })) -->
<!-- ``` -->

Scoring Rules
===

We now turn to scoring rules and how these are used in entity resolution tasks.

Scoring Rules
===

- Record attributes are often distorted by noise. Why would this occur?

- Linkage rules should account for such noise, distortions, and errors through scoring rules or functions. 

- Examples commonly used for westernized names are the Edit (Levenshtein), Jaro, and Jaro-Winkler distance functions. 

Edit (Levenshtein) distance (1966)
===

The Edit distance calculates the minimum number of substitutions required to transform a string $s_1$ into a string $s_2.$

Formally, $$\text{Edit} = 1-\frac{L}{maxLength(s_1, s_2)}.$$

Example
===

Consider the number of substitutions required to transform from **Adam** to **Alan.** Use the Edit distance formulate to find the similarity score that is between $[0,1].$

Solution
===

The number of substitutions required is $L=2.$

This is normalized into a similarity function using the following:

$$\text{Edit} = 1-\frac{L}{maxLength(s_1, s_2)} = 1-2/4=1-0.5=0.5$$

Solution
===

Let's verify this in \texttt{R}.

```{r}
s1 <- "Adam"
s2 <- "Alan"
levenshteinSim("s1", "s2")
```

Jaro-Winkler
===

- The Jaro distance (1989), called J, considered common characters and character transpositions.

- The Jaro-Winkler (1990) similarity measure, denoted JW is:

\begin{center}
$ JW(A,B)= J(A,B) + \textcolor{red}{0.1p}(1-J(A,B)) $
\end{center}

where $p$ is the \# of the first four characters that agree exactly.

Example
===

Let's return to the example of comparing Adam and Alan. 

- Here, $p = 1.$

- Given the complexity, we will calculate J and JW using \texttt{R}. 


Example
===

```{r}
## It seems Jaro is not supported in R
jarowinkler(s1,s2)
```

e.g. Adam vs Alan: p=1,  J= 0.67 and JW=0.7.

These work well on English names that are less than 7 characters. 

Other distance functions
===

There are many other distance functions, such as the Jaccard, Hamming, and Cosine distances just to name a few. 

Recap
===

You should now be familiar with the following:

- the pipeline approach
- deterministic record linkage methods
- exact matching and extensions
- scoring functions

Discussion: How might you put these rules together to form more complex entity resolution rules?
